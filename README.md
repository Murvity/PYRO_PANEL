# 🎇Fireworks Playground Script
---
### 📌 This is a script for the game [Fireworks Playground](https://www.roblox.com/games/10846691679/Fireworks-Playground) on Roblox. The features are as follows:
- Autofarm
- Retrieve Collectables (e.g., Baubles)
- Teleports
- Basic Movement Settings (e.g., WalkSpeed)
---
### ⚠️ A few things need to be addressed before you run this:
- This will not work on Solara or Xeno. I have only tested this on **[Bunni](https://discord.com/invite/bunnilol)** and **[Delta](deltaexploits.gg)**.
- The script is *obfuscated* to ensure that functionality is preserved for as long as possible.
- Upon execution, it will freeze for a few seconds. If there's any issues, let me know **[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zv3QtezvyQg)**.
